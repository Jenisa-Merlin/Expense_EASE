Description:
The Expense Tracker project is a Java-based financial management application designed
to help users effectively track and control their expenses and incomes. It provides a user-friendly
interface with features for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting financial records. The
application maintains a real-time balance sheet, ensuring users always have an accurate overview
of their financial position. By categorizing entries as income or expense, users can easily
organize and manage their finances. MySQL is used as the backend database, and Java Database
Connectivity (JDBC) facilitates secure data storage and retrieval. This project empowers users to
make informed financial decisions and stay in control of their budgets.
One of its standout features is the real-time balance sheet, providing users with an up-to-
the-minute snapshot of their financial standing. As users interact with the application, this
balance sheet is dynamically updated, giving them a continuously evolving view of their
financial health. The ability to categorize entries as either "Income" or "Expense" simplifies
financial organization and allows for clear differentiation between sources of income and areas
of expenditure.
